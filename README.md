# Barbel
Barbel is a chess engine written in Rust. On version 1.0.0 it plays with strength of around 2500 (measured against CCRL Blitz engines).
## About
It uses a simple hand-crafted evaluation function with a fairly advanced search function.
Supports UCI protocol.

This project was created as my thesis. further updates will likely feature some ML experimentation.
